# HTTP
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee.
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

```markdown
- A client (the browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
- An web server receives the request
- The server runs an application to process the request
- The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
- The client (the browser) receives the response
```

The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9

### HTTP V0.9 (1991)

The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.

```markdown
Get /
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>
```

No metadata, no HTTP headers, no content negotiation

### HTTP V1.0 (1996)

To expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields. RFC 1945 officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996.

- Request may have multiple newline seperated headers and HTTP version
- Response has its own seperated headers and is prefixed with response status code
- Connection is closed after transfer complete

```markdown
=> curl -v0 https://twitter.com

* Connected to twitter.com port 443 (#0)

> Get / HTTP/1.0
> Host: twitter.com
> User-Agent: curl/743.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
< Content-type: text/html;charset=utf-8
< pragma: no-cache
<
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>

* Closing connection 0
```

Support is not limited to hypertext(can send images), content in coding, character-set support, media-type negotiations, proxy behaviours, cache authorization and a bunch of things.

### HTTP V1.1 

To satisfy the needs of modern world HTTP V1.1 was developed over a period of roughly 4 years. RFC was published in 1997 followed by an extension in 1999, RFC 2616. 

- HTTP response was boosted by many things, but speacial tribute should be paid to keep-alive connections.
- We have Chunked responses, compressions, byte ranges and pipelining.
- There is more pragma, there is much better caching mechanisms to improve performances.
- There are 24 new status codes
- We got cookies because we wanted to make our apps stateful


```markdown
=> curl -v https://github.com

> Get / HTTP/1.1
> Host: github.com
> User-Agent: curl/743.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Cache-Control: no-cache
<
{ [1370 bytes data]
* Connection #0 to host github.com left intact


**lets make another one**


=> curl -v -H "Range: bytes=0-1024" https://assests-cdn.github.com/../puppy.png

<HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
< Cache-Control: public, max-age=315360000
< Age: 2165764
< Content-Type: image/png
< Content-Range: bytes 0-1024/35407
< Content-Length: 1025
< Connection: keep-alive
<
{ [1025 bytes data]
* Connection #0 to host left intact
```

### HTTP V2.0 

The basis of HTTP 2.0 is SPDY, an experimental protocol developed at Google that had the goal of reducing the latency of web pages and minimizing the cost of deployment complexity and avoiding changes in the network infrastructure. In 2015, ISG approved HTTP V2.0 and HPACK drafts

If I were to do a HTTP/2 request then, for the outside of the server not much would have changed. Its the same exchange headers, status codes, keep-alive connection. To understand the changes we need to look at a slightly more low levels, analyse the packets. Once you are able to decrypt the traffic, we can see new type of packets which HTTP/2 calls them a Frame. So I can see window update and settings and headers, decompressed-header data and we can already decipher the well-known headers.

  
  
  
  

# Difference between HTTP V2.0 and its predecessor

- HTTP/2 is binary instead of textual. It introduces a binary framing layer.
- HTTP/2 allows multiplexing of requests and responses
- Due to multiplexing, we require only one single connection per origin
- HTTP/2 can also do server push (push resources pro-actively without the need for the client to request those)
- HTTP/2 can do flow control but at the application level
- HTTP/2 also uses header compression to reduce the overhead






# Difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs

-Java Script is a client side coding
   Node js enables server side coding written in Java Script
-Java Script is a language
    Node js is not a language but it has V8 engine that runs Java script on the server side.
    (Node js contains V8 engine bundled with some libraries to do I/O and networking)
-Java script runs inside the browser
    Node js runs outside the browser [i.e server]
-Java script provides behaviour to your pages [HTML,CSS]
    Node js is a server can perform server functions like reading files ,database objects,etc.     
-Node js has "npm" - Node Package Manager - Used for sharing  and reusing the code.







# What happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. URL is the address of the website which you can find in the address bar of your web browser. It is a reference to a resource on the internet, be it images, hypertext pages, audio/video files, etc.

Example :
https;//github.com/


URL is sent to DNS. DNS is short for Domain Name System. Like a phonebook, DNS maintains and maps the name of the website, i.e. URL, and particular IP address it links to. Every URL on the internet has a unique IP address which is of the computer which hosts the server of the website requested.

Steps for what happens when we enter a URL :

- Browser checks cache for DNS entry to find the corresponding IP address of website.   
- If not found in cache, ISPâ€™s (Internet Service Provider) DNS server initiates a DNS query to find IP address of server that hosts the domain name.
- The requests are sent using small data packets that contain information content of request and IP address it is destined for.
- Browser initiates a TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) connection with the server using synchronize(SYN) and acknowledge(ACK) messages.
- Browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. GET or POST request.
- Server on the host computer handles that request and sends back a response. It assembles a response in some format like JSON, XML and HTML.
- Server sends out an HTTP response along with the status of response.
- Browser displays HTML content

```markdown
http://www.guvi.in

> http://234.23.45.6.80/index.html
//DNS convert host name to IP address and then port
//Initiates the HTTP request and initiates GET method(default)
//Server sends out an HTTP response along and browser displays HTML content
```
