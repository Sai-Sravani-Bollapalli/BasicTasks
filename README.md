### HTTP

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee.
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

```markdown
- A client (the browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
- An web server receives the request
- The server runs an application to process the request
- The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
- The client (the browser) receives the response
```

The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9

### HTTP V0.9 (1991)

The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.

```markdown
Get /
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>
```

No metadata, no HTTP headers, no content negotiation

### HTTP V1.0 (1996)

To expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields. RFC 1945 officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996.

-Request may have multiple newline seperated headers and HTTP version
-Response has its own seperated headers and is prefixed with response status code
-Connection is closed after transfer complete

```markdown
=> curl -v0 https://twitter.com

* Connected to twitter.com port 443 (#0)

> Get / HTTP/1.0
> Host: twitter.com
> User-Agent: curl/743.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
< Content-type: text/html;charset=utf-8
< pragma: no-cache
<
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>

* Closing connection 0
```

Support is not limited to hypertext(can send images), content in coding, character-set support, media-type negotiations, proxy behaviours, cache authorization and a bunch of things.

### HTTP V1.1 

To satisfy the needs of modern world HTTP V1.1 was developed over a period of roughly 4 years. RFC was published in 1997 followed by an extension in 1999, RFC 2616. 

-HTTP response was boosted by many things, but speacial tribute should be paid to keep-alive connections.
-We have Chunked responses, compressions, byte ranges and pipelining.
-There is more pragma, there is much better caching mechanisms to improve performances.
-There are 24 new status codes
-We got cookies because we wanted to make our apps stateful


```markdown
=> curl -v https://github.com

> Get / HTTP/1.1
> Host: github.com
> User-Agent: curl/743.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Cache-Control: no-cache
<
{ [1370 bytes data]
* Connection #0 to host github.com left intact

**lets make another one**

=> curl -v -H "Range: bytes=0-1024" https://assests-cdn.github.com/../puppy.png

<HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
< Cache-Control: public, max-age=315360000
< Age: 2165764
< Content-Type: image/png
< Content-Range: bytes 0-1024/35407
< Content-Length: 1025
< Connection: keep-alive
<
{ [1025 bytes data]
* Connection #0 to host left intact
```

### HTTP V2.0 

The basis of HTTP 2.0 is SPDY, an experimental protocol developed at Google that had the goal of reducing the latency of web pages and minimizing the cost of deployment complexity and avoiding changes in the network infrastructure. In 2015, ISG approved HTTP V2.0 and HPACK drafts

If I were to do a HTTP/2 request then, for the outside of the server not much would have changed. Its the same exchange headers, status codes, keep-alive connection. To understand the changes we need to look at a slightly more low levels, analyse the packets. Once you are able to decrypt the traffic, we can see new type of packets which HTTP/2 calls them a Frame. So I can see window update and settings and headers, decompressed-header data and we can already decipher the well-known headers.


### Difference between HTTP V2.0 and its predecessor

-HTTP/2 is binary instead of textual. It introduces a binary framing layer.
-HTTP/2 allows multiplexing of requests and responses
-Due to multiplexing, we require only one single connection per origin
-HTTP/2 can also do server push (push resources pro-actively without the need for the client to request those)
-HTTP/2 can do flow control but at the application level
-HTTP/2 also uses header compression to reduce the overhead







## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sai-Sravani-Bollapalli/Blog/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sai-Sravani-Bollapalli/Blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
