### HTTP

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

```markdown
A client (the browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
An web server receives the request
The server runs an application to process the request
The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
The client (the browser) receives the response
```

The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9

### HTTP V0.9 (1991)

The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.
