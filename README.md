### HTTP

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

```markdown
- A client (the browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
- An web server receives the request
- The server runs an application to process the request
- The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
- The client (the browser) receives the response
```

The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9

### HTTP V0.9 (1991)

The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.

```markdown
Get /
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>
```

No metadata, no HTTP headers, no content negotiation

### HTTP V1.0 (1996)

To expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields. RFC 1945 officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996.

- Request may have multiple newline seperated headers and HTTP version
- Response has its own seperated headers and is prefixed with response staus line
- Connection is closed after transfer complete

```markdown
=> curl -vo https://twitter.com

* Connected to twitter.com port 443 (#0)

> Get / HTTP/1.0
> Host: twitter.com
> User-Agent: curl/743.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
< Content-type: text/html;charset=utf-8
<pragma: no-cache
<
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>

* Closing connection 0
```

Support is not limited to hypertext(can send images), content in coding, character-set support, media-type negotiations, proxy behaviours, cache authorization and a bunch of things.

### HTTP V1.1 (1996)

To satisfy the needs of modern world HTTP V1.1 was developed over a period of roughly 4 years. RFC was published in 1997 followed by an extension in 1999, RFC 2616.
